## key Features

User Authentication: Next Door Service allows users to easily register, log in, and log out using their email and password. 

Featured Service Listings: Browse through a wide range of home services, such as plumbing, electrical work, veterinary care, cleaning, and professional chefs. Services are displayed in an intuitive, easy-to-navigate UI, with all service data dynamically pulled from the backend to ensure users always see up-to-date information. Each service has its own detailed page, providing all relevant information. For admins, there is an option to delete services directly from the database with a simple click. Users can also add services to their favorites list for easy access later, creating a personalized collection of preferred services.

Add and Manage Services: Users can book, update, delete, or manage services through a user-friendly interface.

Dark and Light Mode: Next Door Service offers users the flexibility to switch between light and dark themes with ease. A convenient theme button is located at the top of the platform, allowing users to toggle between a bright, clean white theme and a sleek, low-light dark theme. This customization ensures a comfortable viewing experience, whether you're browsing during the day or using the platform in low-light environments. The smooth transition between themes is enhanced with subtle animations, giving users a seamless and visually pleasing experience while navigating the platform.

Database: Next Door Service uses a secure MongoDB database to store all service and user data, including user profiles, service details, and preferences. All sensitive information, like passwords, is encrypted to ensure security. Firebase is used for user authentication, providing a safe and secure sign-up and login process, with encrypted passwords and secure email verification. User data is protected with SSL encryption, ensuring your information remains private at all times. Regular backups are performed to prevent data loss, and we adhere to best security practices to keep your information safe.

With the added benefit of smooth animations, Next Door Service delivers a modern, user-friendly experience that makes managing your home services simple and enjoyable. Whether you need to book, manage, or add services, our platform offers an intuitive and secure way to get things done.
